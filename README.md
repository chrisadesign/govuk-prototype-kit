# GOV.UK Prototype Kit Starter

This is a fork of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit with some additional settings and features.

> This is an unofficial version of the kit, it is not supported by government. Some of the features have been hacked in quickly to suit my own needs which means they might not work perfectly and will almost certainly go out of date as GOV designs and features are updated.

It includes:

- a new ‘internal’ config variable which replace the GOV.UK logo with the service name and remove some other things
- a prototype phase banner
- a link in the footer to the currrent page in the heroku app
- a link in the footer to the git repo
- a feature and versioning system
- a date filter
- the accessible autocomplete component
- GOV.UK guide and publisher component styles (add 'guide' class to main)
