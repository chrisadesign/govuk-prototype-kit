# GOV.UK Prototype Kit Starter

> Upgraded to v13 of the prototype kit!

## About

This is a copy the GOV.UK Prototype Kit with some additional settings and features.

It is a community resource of the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](http://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/). The Prototype Kit team is not responsible for it and cannot support you with using it.

If you&rsquo;ve got a question, need support, or want to contribute you can [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisadesign/govuk-prototype-kit/issues).

## Included

This starter has added:

- a feature and versioning system
- a new "questions" block within content one to reduce code in form pages
- an internal layout which uses a custom header component (example internal page)
- the accessible autocomplete component integrated, you can upgrade any select by adding the 'js-autocomplete' class (example autocomplete page)
- the "secret" 'settings.scss' file, with most options listed with their default values, should hopefully make rebranding easier
- an inverse button to use on dark backgrounds, 'govuk-button--inverse'
- a link in the footer to the current page on your hosted prototype
- a link in the footer to the git repository

> The department name for the internal header, and both the hosted prototype and the repo URLs are configured in session-data-defaults.js file.

## Usage

The repository is a template, you can create a new repo of your own based on this one. Alternatively, you can download or clone the code.

To run the kit locally use **npm install** then **npm run dev**.
